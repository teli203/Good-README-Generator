README Generator
This is ran directly through a command line interface. Before attempting to try please run an "npm install", after cloning the repo to update the package.json files. After that is complete you may run "node index.js" for the questions to start prompting you. These questions are based on a typical project or assignment that needs a simple readme.


BASIC README CONTENTS:
* Installation
* Contribution to the project or assignment
* How to use the app
* Licenses used for the assignment or project
* Test
* Questions  

I welcome any contribution feel free to have at it and thanks in advance!
